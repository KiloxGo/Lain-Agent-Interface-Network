# L.A.I.N. Development Log

This file records implementation history, milestone outcomes, important decisions, problems found during development, and the handoff state for the next coding session.

It is intentionally different from the architecture documents:

- `docs/*.md` describe what the system **should be**;
- `ROADMAP.md` describes what we **plan to build**;
- `DEVLOG.md` records what **actually happened**.

The Git history remains the authoritative record of exact commits.

---

## Legacy note

The pre-reboot implementation is preserved on the `legacy/v0` branch.

The old repository also contained a historical `DEVLOG.md` describing the earlier Rust + React rewrite, WebSocket connectivity, and file-based memory experiments. That log recorded dates as 2025-04-15, while the corresponding Git history is from 2026. The legacy branch is preserved unchanged; this v1 log uses the current Git history and reboot timeline.

Important legacy milestones include:

- Python + Live2D / ASR / TTS prototype;
- first Rust + React rewrite;
- WebSocket chat;
- direct LLM adapter;
- file-based profile/history memory;
- topic extraction and consolidation.

Those experiments are useful historical evidence, but they are not architectural precedent for v1.

## 2026-10-04 — Architecture reboot

### Milestone

`reboot: "Reset the Wired"`

### Why the reboot happened

The previous implementation had begun to reproduce responsibilities already owned by modern agent runtimes:

- LLM client/runtime logic;
- conversation history;
- memory extraction;
- retrieval;
- topic consolidation;
- parts of a generic agent loop.

The project direction was changed from "build another agent runtime" to:

> Lain is a persistent resident agent and an agent control plane for existing worker agents.

### Completed

- archived the previous implementation to `legacy/v0`;
- removed the old Rust kernel, React frontend, memory implementation, and chat loop from active `main`;
- established documentation-first architecture;
- added:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/PRODUCT.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md`
  - `docs/RUNTIME_MODEL.md`
  - `docs/AGENT_BACKENDS.md`
  - `docs/MEMORY.md`
  - `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
  - `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

### Important decisions

- Kernel is the server-side source of truth.
- Web/TUI/future integrations are clients of the Kernel.
- Worker-agent intelligence stays inside external harnesses.
- Lain owns orchestration, continuity, memory, and her private world.
- Worker context/transcripts are not Lain memory.
- Provider-specific protocol objects must not leak into the core domain.
- Runtime profiles will replace global configuration mutation.
- 24-hour residency is event-driven, not continuous model inference.
- GitHub Actions should remain lightweight and deterministic.
- Milestone commits may keep the project's short atmospheric naming style.

### Next step at the time

Build Phase 1: a durable headless Kernel foundation before integrating any real worker.

---

## 2026-10-04 — Phase 1: Kernel foundation

### Milestone

`foundation: "A Place to Remain"`

### Goal

Create a durable headless `laind` process with provider-neutral domain state, persistence, recovery, a minimal authenticated API, and no worker-agent implementation.

### Completed

#### Rust workspace

Created a minimal workspace:

```text
Cargo.toml
Cargo.lock
crates/
  lain-kernel/
```

The initial implementation intentionally remains a single crate rather than splitting into speculative micro-crates.

#### Domain model

Implemented strong domain identifiers:

- `WorkSessionId`
- `TurnId`
- `EventId`
- `ApprovalId`
- `RuntimeProfileId`
- provider-neutral `BackendKind`

Implemented `WorkSession` and a concrete `WorkSessionState` transition matrix.

Important semantics:

- `Idle` means a reusable session with no active turn;
- `Completed` means a confirmed terminal session state;
- `Cancelled` means confirmed cancellation, not merely a cancellation request;
- `Disconnected` and `Unknown` do not imply failure.

#### Operational persistence

Added SQLite persistence with:

- transactional schema migration;
- committed `Cargo.lock`;
- WAL mode;
- durable WorkSession snapshots;
- restart recovery;
- database ownership lock;
- fail-closed behavior for corrupt/unsupported persisted state.

On restart, previously active states that cannot be confirmed without a live backend are reconciled to `Unknown` rather than guessed.

#### Kernel ownership

The Kernel owns:

- lifecycle state;
- committed in-memory WorkSession projection;
- storage mutation ordering;
- event publication ordering.

Session changes are persisted before the in-memory projection/event notification is committed.

#### Event foundation

Added a bounded Tokio broadcast channel.

Initial normalized events:

- `SessionCreated`
- `SessionStateChanged`

The channel is a live notification mechanism, not a durable audit log.

Slow subscribers receive lag and must resnapshot authoritative state.

#### Local API

Added an Axum HTTP API:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /ready`
- `GET /v1/work-sessions`
- `GET /v1/work-sessions/{id}`

Phase 1 intentionally keeps the API read-only.

All routes require a bearer token.

The daemon binds to loopback only in Phase 1.

#### Secret handling

`LAIN_API_TOKEN`:

- is required;
- is validated;
- is never serialized;
- is redacted from Debug/errors;
- is compared using constant-time byte comparison;
- is not stored in SQLite or Lain domain state.

#### Lifecycle

Implemented:

- boot;
- recovery;
- ready state;
- SIGINT/SIGTERM and Windows Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break handling;
- bounded graceful HTTP shutdown;
- storage close/reopen behavior.

### Validation

The Phase 1 test suite covers:

- domain IDs;
- complete WorkSession transition matrix;
- configuration validation/redaction;
- workspace validation;
- persistence round trips;
- restart reconciliation;
- corrupt-state fail-closed behavior;
- database single ownership;
- commit-before-event ordering;
- storage failure without false event publication;
- subscriber lag behavior;
- API authentication/status/errors;
- real TCP shutdown and database reopen.

Documented validation commands:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --locked --workspace
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

No GitHub Actions workflow was added.

### Known limitations / deferred work

- no worker runtime is started;
- no Codex protocol exists yet;
- no public session-create/prompt/cancel API exists yet;
- no Turn or Approval entity is implemented yet;
- no provider-native session identity is persisted yet;
- no durable event timeline exists;
- no live WebSocket/SSE client event API exists;
- no RuntimeProfile registry/SecretRef store exists yet;
- no Lain Actor, memory, World, scheduler, Web, or TUI exists yet;
- native Linux signal behavior still deserves direct Linux validation.

### Phase 1 review

The implementation matches the intended architecture well enough to proceed.

Notable good choices:

- conservative restart semantics instead of pretending worker state is known;
- no speculative backend framework;
- no fake worker implementation just to satisfy APIs;
- provider-neutral domain names;
- strict separation between operational state and future Lain memory;
- event publication only after durable mutation;
- explicit lag/resnapshot semantics.

### Handoff to Phase 2

Phase 2 should integrate **Codex App Server** as the first real worker.

Before locking the adapter contract, verify the installed/current Codex version and protocol behavior.

The next milestone must settle, with evidence:

- App Server process ownership and restart behavior;
- initialize/initialized handshake;
- thread creation and resume;
- turn lifecycle;
- provider thread/turn identity persistence;
- event normalization;
- cancellation acknowledgement;
- approval request/response mapping;
- disconnect/reconciliation behavior;
- multiple concurrent WorkSessions;
- how live worker events are exposed to future clients.

Do not begin Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, Lain memory, or UI work as part of Phase 2.
